# 3-Level-Authentication-System
## Overview
The Hybrid Authentication System (HAS) is a multi-layered authentication framework designed to enhance security by combining several authentication mechanisms. It simulates biometric authentication, behavioral analysis, CAPTCHA verification, and two-factor authentication (2FA) to provide a more secure and user-friendly login experience.

## Features
Biometric Authentication (Simulated): Uses fingerprint or facial recognition as the first line of authentication.</br>
Behavioral Authentication: Analyzes user behavior (e.g., typing speed) to continuously verify identity.</br>
CAPTCHA Verification: Prevents automated bots from accessing the system by requiring CAPTCHA input.</br>
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adds an extra layer of security through OTP verification sent to the user.</br>
User-Friendly Interface: The system is designed to be easy to use, while providing strong security against potential threats.</br>

## How It Works
The authentication process involves the following steps:</br>

Biometric Authentication: Simulates biometric verification.</br>
Behavioral Authentication: Analyzes typing speed to verify the user's identity.</br>
CAPTCHA Verification: Ensures the user is a human, not a bot.</br>
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): The user must provide a One-Time Password (OTP) to complete authentication.</br>
If the user successfully completes all steps, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.</br>
